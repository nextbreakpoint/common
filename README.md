    </dependency>

## Documentation

The primary goal of this library is to provide the types for writing code in an elegant and concise style.
Also, the library aims to provide the building blocks for creating composable and reusable code.   

For instance, a typical fragment of code for handling exceptions in Java looks like:

    try {
        doSomething();
    } catch (SomeException e) {
        handleException(e);
    }

Using Command and Either provided in the library we can rewrite the same code in a more elegant style:

    Command.of(() -> doSomething())
        .execute()
        .observe()
        .onFailure(e -> handleException(e))
        .get();

### Either class

Either implements a fluent interface for composing operations and handling errors.

Either can be created from a value or an exception:

    Either.success(value)
    Either.failure(exception)

Use get(), orElse(), orElseGet() to get the value:

    Either.success(value).get()
    Either.success(value).orElse(otherValue)
    Either.success(value).orElseGet(() -> otherValue)

Use orThrow() to rethrow the exception if present:

    Either.failure(exception).orThrow()
    Either.failure(exception).orThrow(e -> new SomeException(e))

Use or() to produce an alternative result:

    // the composed either will ignore the failure and return the alternative value
    Either.failure(exception).or(Either.success(value))

Use map() and flatMap() to compose transformations:

    Either.success(value).map(value -> transform(value))
    Either.success(value).flatMap(value -> Either.success(transform(value)))

Use exception() to get the exception if present:

    // always null if either is success
    Either.success(value).exception()
    // always not null if either is failure
    Either.failure(exception).exception()

Use isSuccess() and isFailure() to check the status:

    // always returns true if either is success
    Either.success(value).isSuccess()
    // always returns true if either is failure
    Either.failure(exception).isFailure()

Use observe() to observe the status:

    Either.success(value)
        .observe()
        .onSuccess(value -> handleValue(value))
        .onFailure(error -> handleError(error))
        .get()

Use optional() to create an Optional:

    Either.success(value).optional()

Use stream() to create a Stream:

    Either.success(value).stream()

### Command class

Command implements a fluent interface for composing operations and execute them as single command.

Command can be created from a value, an exception, an instance of Either, or an instance of Callable:

    Command.value(value)
    Command.error(exception)
    Command.of(Either.success(value))
    Command.of(() -> doSomething())

Use execute() to execute the composed operation:

    // it will execute the command and return the result as instance of Either
    Command.of(() -> doSomething()).execute();

Use map() and flatMap() to compose operations:

    Command.of(() -> doSomething()).map(value -> processValue(value));
    Command.of(() -> doSomething()).flatMap(value -> Command.of(processValue(value)));
